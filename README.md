# EthAvaxAdv1
This repository contains two Solidity smart contracts: `Vault.sol` and `ERC20.sol`. ERC20 will serve as the main contract to be deployed, while the vault will be implementing a withdraw and deposit function to interact with the ERC20 contract.

2. Finish setting up your Avalanche subnet network and deploy the network through your CLI.
3. Connect the network into your metamask
4. Import the provided account where the tokens are deployed through its private key
5. Use injected provider as the environment before deploying your contracts
6. Deploy your ERC20 contract, and use the contract address as the argument for deploying your Vault contract.
